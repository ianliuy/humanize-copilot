"""Per-session, per-file log streaming logic for the dashboard.

Implements the snapshot+append+resync+eof event sequence frozen in
``docs/streaming-protocol.md``. The module is pure logic: it does not
own a poll loop or HTTP transport. Callers drive ``poll()`` and turn
the returned event dicts into SSE frames or any other transport.

Event shape (matches the contract):

    {"type": "snapshot", "path": <basename>, "offset": <int>, "bytes_b64": <str>, "eof": <bool>}
    {"type": "append",   "path": <basename>, "offset": <int>, "bytes_b64": <str>}
    {"type": "resync",   "path": <basename>, "reason": "truncated|rotated|recreated|missing|overflow"}
    {"type": "eof",      "path": <basename>}

The streamer assigns a strictly increasing ``id`` per stream and
retains the last 256 events for ``Last-Event-Id`` reconnects (per the
contract). Larger snapshots are chunked at 64 KiB.

    A stream is created with the basename of the cache log file (e.g.
    ``round-3-codex-run.log``) and the absolute path to the parent
    cache directory. The basename is what appears in the ``path``
    field of every emitted event so clients only see relative names.

    Lifecycle:

    - ``snapshot()`` — issue zero or more ``snapshot`` events covering
      the bytes already on disk. May be called multiple times during
      reconnect; the second call resets internal counters before
      replaying from offset 0.
    - ``poll()`` — observe the file once; emit ``append`` if new bytes
      appeared, ``resync`` followed by a fresh snapshot if the file
      shrank or its inode changed, ``resync`` with reason ``missing``
      if the file disappeared, or no events when nothing changed.
    - ``mark_eof()`` — caller signals that the writer has closed (the
      session reached a terminal state); a single ``eof`` event is
      emitted and subsequent ``poll()`` calls are no-ops.

    Events are returned with a monotonic per-stream id. ``replay``
    serves a ``Last-Event-Id`` reconnect by returning all retained
    events newer than the supplied id; if the id is out of the
    retention window it returns a ``resync(overflow)`` plus a fresh
    snapshot path that the caller should run through ``snapshot()``.
