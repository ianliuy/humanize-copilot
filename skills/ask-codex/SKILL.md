# Ask Codex

Send a question or task to Codex and return the response.

## How to Use

Execute the ask-codex script with the user's arguments:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/ask-codex.sh" $ARGUMENTS
```

## Interpreting Output

- The script outputs Codex's response to **stdout** and status info to **stderr**
- Read the stdout output carefully and incorporate Codex's response into your answer
- If the script exits with a non-zero code, report the error to the user

## Error Handling

| Exit Code | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| 0 | Success - Codex response is in stdout |
| 1 | Validation error (missing codex, empty question, invalid flags) |
| 124 | Timeout - suggest using `--codex-timeout` with a larger value |
| Other | Codex process error - report the exit code and any stderr output |

## Notes

- The response is saved to `.humanize/skill/<timestamp>/output.md` for reference
- Default model is `gpt-5.4:xhigh` with a 3600-second timeout
